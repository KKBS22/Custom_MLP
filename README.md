# Custom_MLP
Multi Layer Perceptron is a class of Feed Forward ANN, built from scratch to classify a image data set.

# Technology
* Programming : Python
* Keywords : Perceptron, Backpropagation Algorithm, Activation Function, Loss Function

# Abstract 
In this problem we build an MLP from scratch and implement the Backpropagation learning algorithm to train the network with
dataset that contains 24754 samples, each with 784 features divided into 4 classes (0,1,2,3).

The MLP network:
* Input Layer : 784 Inputs
  * Activation Function : Sigmoid 
* Hidden Layer : 770
* Output Layer : 4 which is the number of classes
  * Output Activation Function : Softmax
